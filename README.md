# Dynamic remodeling of the E. coli  interactome in response to environmental perturbations

# Summary

* This is an R analysis pipeline for scoring protein interaction remodeling from co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF/MS) data 

* This pipeline was developed to profile interactome remodeling from CF/MS data of *E. coli* grown under 10 different growth media but is applicable to other studies of interactome remodeling (e.g. disease subtypes, brain regions, tissue atlases)

* This pipeline assigns quantitative remodeling scores to each protein-protein interaction (PPI) instead of predicting PPI presence/absence

* Each PPI is assigned a remodeling score for each input sample relative to a designated reference/baseline sample

* The PPI remodeling scores can easily be summarized at the levels of: individual proteins, complexes, pathways, etc.

# Inputs

* **Conditional CF/MS data**  
  * *Long format*: Data frame with 5 columns (protein, fraction, condition, replicate, intensity), or
  * *Wide format*: List of protein-by-fraction data frames for each condition, or
  * *MaxQuant files*: proteinGroups.txt or peptides.txt
  * *(Optional)*: Peptide-level data with same format plus peptide ID column
  
  One condition is designated as the reference/baseline condition to compare other conditions against 
  
* **Reference interactome**
  * A table with 2 columns; one per interactor
  
  The reference interactome can come from public databases (e.g. BioGRID, STRING) or independently generated by the user
  
# Output 

Data frame with conditional remodeling scores for each PPI in reference interactome

# What do the remodeling scores represent?

* For a given PPI in a given condition, the remodeling score represents the change in the interacting proteins' profile similarities compared to the reference condition
* A score of 0 means no change in PPI behavior compared to the reference condition
* A positive score suggests PPI disruption
* A negative score suggests PPI strengthening
